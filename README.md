# Colony Survival Waterbucket Mod by Scarabol

This mod adds two new item types *waterbucket* and *waterbucketfilled*. To craft a water bucket you need 3 iron ingots. If you place the water bucket inside water it consumes the water and gives you a filled water bucket in your stockpile. If the filled water bucket is placed, it spills all water inside! Be careful!
